# Embedding X Posts in Tuzuru: Simple URL Magic

> **Disclaimer**: This article is AI-generated content created for demonstration purposes of the Tuzuru static blog generator.

One of Tuzuru's most convenient features is its automatic X (Twitter) post embedding. You don't need complex embed codes or pluginsâ€”just paste the X post URL directly into your markdown, and Tuzuru automatically converts it to a beautiful, interactive embed.

## How It Works

Tuzuru automatically detects X post URLs in your markdown content and transforms them into rich embeds during the site generation process. No manual HTML required!

### Simple Example

Just paste the URL on its own line:

```markdown
Here's the latest update from the Swift team:

https://x.com/SwiftLang/status/1952858529423081666

The community response has been amazing!
```

Tuzuru will automatically convert this URL into a fully interactive X embed with:
- Original tweet content and media
- Author information and avatar
- Engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies)
- Reply threads (when enabled)
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Real-World Examples

### Swift Language Updates

The Swift team regularly shares important updates about the language development:

This shows how the Swift community stays connected with the latest developments and improvements.

### Developer Community Engagement

The Swift team actively engages with the developer community, sharing insights and updates:

These real-time discussions provide valuable context for developers working with Swift and help build a stronger community around the language.

https://x.com/reactjs/status/1234567890123456789

This update will significantly impact how we handle state management in future projects.
```

### Use for Timely Content
X embeds work best for:
- Breaking news and announcements
- Real-time event coverage
- Community reactions and discussions
- Behind-the-scenes insights
- Live Q&A sessions

### Maintain Accessibility
While Tuzuru handles most accessibility concerns automatically, consider:
- Adding alt text descriptions for users with screen readers
- Providing summary context for embedded threads
- Including fallback text for users who can't load embeds

## Technical Details

### Supported URLs
Tuzuru recognizes these X URL formats:
- `https://twitter.com/username/status/123`
- `https://x.com/username/status/123`
- `https://mobile.twitter.com/username/status/123`

### Privacy Considerations
Tuzuru embeds respect user privacy by:
- Loading embeds only when visible (lazy loading)
- Providing GDPR-compliant consent options (when configured)
- Supporting privacy-first browsing modes

### Performance Metrics
- **Load time**: ~200ms additional per embed
- **Bundle size**: +15KB for X widgets (cached)
- **Core Web Vitals**: Optimized for minimal CLS impact

## Troubleshooting

### URL Not Embedding?
- Ensure the post is public (private/protected posts won't embed)
- Check that the URL is on its own line in markdown
- Verify the status ID is correct

### Slow Loading?
- Tuzuru lazy-loads embeds by default
- Check your internet connection
- Consider reducing the number of embeds per page

## Conclusion

Tuzuru's automatic X embedding makes it incredibly easy to enrich your blog posts with real-time social content. Simply paste the URL, and let Tuzuru handle the rest. This seamless integration helps you create more engaging, contextual content without the technical overhead.

Try it yourself: find an interesting X post, paste the URL into your next Tuzuru blog post, and watch the magic happen!
