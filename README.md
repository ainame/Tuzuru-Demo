# Tuzuru Demo Blog

This is a demonstration blog showcasing the capabilities of [Tuzuru](https://github.com/ainame/Tuzuru), a static blog generator CLI tool written in Swift.

**Notes:**

You don't need to git commit the artefact directory `./blog` or `.build` for intermediate build cache,
but I deliberately did it for the visibility of real output of the tuzuru command.
